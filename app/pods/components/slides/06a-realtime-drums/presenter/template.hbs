  <p class="p-4">
    {{#each (array 'kick' 'clap') as |sound|}}
      {{content.button
        text=sound
        onClick=(action (broadcast 'playSound' (hash sound=sound)))
      }}
    {{/each}}
  </p>

    Notice that the drum sounds aren't playing at the same time on all phones. Weâ€™re all connected to a range of different mobile networks, and due to the nature of the Internet, even a single phone will see different latencies from one real time message to the next.

    This is even clearer if I trigger a drum beat to play, this will sound pretty bad.
